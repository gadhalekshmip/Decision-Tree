# Decision-Tree

This project implements a Decision Tree algorithm, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Decision Trees create a flowchart-like structure, where each internal node represents a feature, each branch represents a decision based on that feature, and each leaf node represents the outcome or prediction.
